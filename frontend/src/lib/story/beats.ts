Long evenings bent over parchment, ink smudged on their fingers, as they worked through mathematical problems by candlelight. His father’s eyes always burned with something more than simple curiosity - something Carl only half understood. Each lesson carried a story of the Order of the Olympiad, of Archimedes’ daring, of the struggle to preserve reason.',

Beside him, Uncle Friedrich bows his head, the Duke of Brunswick’s support behind him, but even that seemed fragile against the weight of loss.',
