I never even met Archimedes … all I know of him and the Order is what my father taught me during our lessons."',
      'Crossing the small stone bridge leading back to the stables, Carl feels a shiver course through him, not from the night air but from a strange, heavy sense of connection - like unseen eyes watching, or an echo of Archimedes’ presence carried in the current below. The moonlight glimmers on the water as if whispering secrets he cannot yet understand.',

He moves with quiet purpose, leading Thunder - the proud steed of Sir Euler - into the aisle. The horse snorts gently, steam rising from its nostrils in the morning chill, as Carl rubs him down with steady strokes.',
      'As his hands work the brush through Thunder’s coat, Carl drifts back to memories of his father. Long evenings bent over parchment, ink smudged on their fingers, as they worked through mathematical problems by candlelight. His father’s eyes always burned with something more than simple curiosity - something Carl only half understood. Each lesson carried a story of the Order of the Olympiad, of Archimedes’ daring, of the struggle to preserve reason.',
      '“Fight for reason. Defend rationality, son,” his father had always insisted, voice steady with conviction. Carl remembered smiling at the time, thinking it was nothing more than romantic idealism. But now, in the quiet dawn, with the strange weight of Emmy’s summons still pressing on him, those words seemed less fanciful - and more like a warning.',

      'Carl stares at the coffin of his father, Gebhard Gauss—a stern man who rarely showed affection, yet whose sudden passing left a void too deep to measure. Beside him, Uncle Friedrich bows his head, the Duke of Brunswick’s support behind him, but even that seemed fragile against the weight of loss.',
      'Carl’s mind drifts as rain collects on his mat of brown hair and dampens his coat. His father’s words echo again: “Fight for reason. Defend rationality, son.” For the first time, Carl does not dismiss them as romantic ideals. He feels the charge settle on his shoulders, heavy and inescapable. “Yes, Father,” he whispers silently, “I will.”',
